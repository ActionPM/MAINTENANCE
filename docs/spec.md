# Service Request Intake and Triage Agent

**Final hand-off build spec (single source of truth)**  
Version: 2026-02-23 (America/Toronto)  
Stack: TypeScript + Next.js + PostgreSQL + pnpm workspaces + JSON Schema + Object storage (presigned uploads)

---

## 0) Executive intent

Build a tenant-facing **in-app chatbot** that converts tenant messages into **schema-enforced Work Orders** labeled with your authoritative taxonomy. The product value is **categorization integrity**, enabling reliable trend analysis, bundling, repeat-issue detection, and later client GL crosswalk mapping.

Two governing constraints:

1. **Governed agent**: the model proposes; deterministic code enforces transitions, validations, and side effects.
2. **Schema-first**: all model outputs and orchestration actions are constrained by JSON Schemas (no free-text categories).

---

## 1) Operating assumptions (confirmed)

### 1.1 Channels

- Intake is **in-app chatbot only**.
- SMS is **outbound updates only** (no SMS intake).
- Photos are **in-app only**, optional in MVP; can attach during intake or after submission via WO detail page.

### 1.2 Tenants and units

- Tenants are **pre-provisioned** by PM onboarding.
- Users may have multiple units; chatbot requires **explicit unit selection** when >1 unit exists.

### 1.3 Identity verification

- Strong OTP verification + ERP tenant-ID matching is later, but **MVP must include secure AuthN/AuthZ**.

### 1.4 Work Order semantics

- **One Issue → one Work Order**.
- Multi-issue messages create multiple WOs linked by `issue_group_id`.
- Staged completion supported (e.g., pests + sealing holes).

### 1.5 Work Order status lifecycle (authoritative)

`created → action_required → scheduled → resolved | cancelled`

### 1.6 Emergency escalation (human bridge)

Per-building configurable chain:  
**Building Manager → Property Manager → Senior Property Manager → fallback after-hours line**  
Call-until-answered behavior; log every attempt; define exhaustion behavior.

### 1.7 Tenant signals (flag-only)

- HVT: **3 open WOs**.
- Tone/frustration score and history summary.
- Signals never change taxonomy outputs or priority automatically.

### 1.8 Languages

MVP English; design supports French later without taxonomy drift.

### 1.9 Jurisdiction/compliance

Canada-wide with policy-driven compliance and jurisdiction overrides (RentSafeTO baseline supported).

---

## 2) Non-negotiables (coding-agent guardrails)

1. **Taxonomy is authoritative**; no free-text categories.
2. **Split first**; never classify until split is finalized.
3. **Schema-lock all model outputs**; invalid outputs retry deterministically or fail safe.
4. **No side effects without tenant confirmation.**
5. **Unit/property derived from membership**; tenant cannot set them.
6. **Append-only events**; corrections are appended, not mutations.
7. **Emergency escalation is deterministic**; model suggests, system confirms + routes.

---

## 3) High-level architecture

- In-app Chat UI
- Orchestrator (deterministic state machine + tool calls + side effects)
- Bounded LLM tools (schema-locked): IssueSplitter, IssueClassifier, FollowUpGenerator
- Risk Engine (deterministic) + Mitigation Templates
- Emergency Router (deterministic contact chain + exhaustion handling)
- Work Order Service (canonical records + status history)
- Notification Service (in-app + outbound SMS only; batching/dedupe + consent/prefs)
- Audit/Retention Layer (append-only events + record bundle export)
- Mock ERP Adapter (MVP) + later real adapters

---

## 4) Technology stack (locked)

- TypeScript / Node.js
- Next.js (UI + API routes)
- PostgreSQL
- pnpm workspaces
- JSON Schema validation for orchestrator actions, LLM I/O, and API DTO mapping
- Object storage for photos (presigned uploads + scanning)

---

## 5) Canonical taxonomy and gating rules

### 5.1 Taxonomy is authoritative

Use your `taxonomy.json` verbatim as the shared analytic spine across clients.

### 5.2 Version pinning

Each conversation pins:

- `taxonomy_version`, `schema_version`, `model_id`, `prompt_version`

**Resumed conversations retain their pinned versions** even if newer versions exist.

### 5.3 Category gating with explicit error path

If classifier returns contradictory fields (e.g., management category but populated maintenance fields):

1. Treat as **classification validation failure** (not schema failure).
2. Run **one targeted retry** with a hard constraint to set irrelevant domain fields to the appropriate non-applicable equivalents.
3. If still contradictory: mark `needs_human_triage` and proceed via escape hatch submission (WO created, status `created`, missing_fields preserved), storing the conflicting outputs in audit events.

---

## 6) Core data model (canonical Work Order)

A WorkOrder includes:

- IDs: `work_order_id`, `issue_group_id`, `issue_id`
- Scope: `client_id`, `property_id`, `unit_id`
- Tenant: `tenant_user_id`, `tenant_account_id`
- Status: `status`, `status_history[]`
- Intake: `raw_text`, `summary_confirmed`, `photos[]`
- Classification: taxonomy enums, `confidence_by_field`, `missing_fields[]`
- Logistics: `pets_present: yes|no|unknown`
- Risk: safety flags, templates shown, escalation attempts
- Notifications history
- Audit versions

Issue group is linkage only; **no aggregate group status** stored.

---

## 7) Append-only events and immutability

Logical event domains (append-only):

- `conversation_events`
- `classification_events`
- `followup_events`
- `work_order_events`
- `risk_events`
- `notification_events`
- `human_override_events`

Accepted MVP decision (2026-03-11):

- These names define the event domains and payload contracts, not a hard requirement for seven physical tables in the first release.
- MVP may consolidate conversation-scoped event domains into a generic append-only event stream if each row preserves `event_type` plus the relevant domain identifiers such as `issue_id` and `work_order_id`.
- A later move to seven dedicated physical tables remains allowed, but it is not required for MVP compliance.

### 7.1 Follow-up event minimum schema

```json
{
  "event_id": "string",
  "conversation_id": "string",
  "issue_id": "string",
  "turn_number": 1,
  "questions_asked": [
    {
      "question_id": "string",
      "field_target": "string",
      "prompt": "string",
      "options": ["..."],
      "answer_type": "enum|yes_no|text"
    }
  ],
  "answers_received": [{ "question_id": "string", "answer": "any", "received_at": "date-time" }],
  "created_at": "date-time"
}
```

Corrections are appended events; effective classification is the latest approved override.

Immutability enforcement:

- app role has INSERT+SELECT only on event tables
- no UPDATE/DELETE grants; optional trigger guards

---

## 8) Rate limiting and payload caps (server-side enforcement)

These defaults are required for abuse/DoS protection and are configurable per client:

- `max_messages_per_minute_per_user = 10`
- `max_new_conversations_per_day_per_user = 20`
- `max_photo_uploads_per_conversation = 10`
- `max_photo_size_mb = 10`
- `max_message_chars = 8000`
- `max_issues_per_conversation = 10`
- `max_issue_text_chars = 500`

Enforcement requirements:

- apply at API gateway/middleware layer
- log violations as security events
- return user-safe errors (e.g., “Too many messages. Please wait a moment.”)

---

## 9) AuthN/AuthZ (MVP required)

Authentication:

- app login → access JWT (short-lived) + refresh token (rotating)

Authorization (hard rules):

- server derives authorized units for tenant_user_id
- tenant cannot set unit/property IDs as truth
- every endpoint enforces membership checks

Multi-unit:

- `unit_selection_required` state until unit selected (except emergency mitigation text can display pre-selection; selection required to proceed).

---

## 10) Orchestrator contract (schema + responsibilities)

### 10.1 Orchestrator is the only controller

Sole component allowed to:

- transition conversation state
- call LLM tools
- create work orders
- send notifications
- trigger emergency router
- write events

### 10.2 OrchestratorAction schema

Create `packages/schemas/orchestrator_action.schema.json`.

**OrchestratorActionRequest**

- `conversation_id` (nullable for create)
- `action_type` (enum)
- `actor: tenant|system|agent|pm_user`
- `tenant_input` (typed by action)
- `idempotency_key` (required for side-effect actions)
- `auth_context` (derived server-side)

**OrchestratorActionResponse**

- `conversation_snapshot`
- `ui_directive` (messages, quick replies, forms, upload prompts)
- `artifacts` (refs + hashes + timestamps + presented_to_tenant flags)
- `pending_side_effects[]`
- `errors[]` (typed, user-safe)

### 10.3 Action types (MVP)

- `CREATE_CONVERSATION`
- `SELECT_UNIT`
- `SUBMIT_INITIAL_MESSAGE` (first message starting intake)
- `SUBMIT_ADDITIONAL_MESSAGE` (free text during follow-ups; queued or treated as clarification per policy)
- `CONFIRM_SPLIT`
- `MERGE_ISSUES`
- `EDIT_ISSUE`
- `ADD_ISSUE`
- `REJECT_SPLIT`
- `ANSWER_FOLLOWUPS`
- `CONFIRM_SUBMISSION`
- `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT`
- `UPLOAD_PHOTO_COMPLETE`
- `RESUME`
- `ABANDON` (system-generated)

---

## 11) Intake state machine (explicit + transition matrix)

Conversation state is internal and separate from Work Order status.

### 11.1 States

**Core**

- `intake_started`
- `unit_selection_required`
- `unit_selected`
- `split_in_progress`
- `split_proposed`
- `split_finalized`
- `classification_in_progress`
- `needs_tenant_input`
- `tenant_confirmation_pending`
- `submitted`

**Failure / recovery**

- `llm_error_retryable`
- `llm_error_terminal`
- `intake_abandoned`
- `intake_expired`

### 11.2 Transition matrix (authoritative, includes photo uploads)

Notation: `{current_state: valid_actions → next_state}`  
Photo uploads are allowed **during intake** and **after submission** with rules below.

- `intake_started`
  - `SELECT_UNIT` → `unit_selected` or `unit_selection_required`
  - `SUBMIT_INITIAL_MESSAGE` (only if unit already resolved) → `split_in_progress`
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `intake_started` _(allowed: attaches to conversation draft; later linked to WOs)_
  - `RESUME` → `intake_started`

- `unit_selection_required`
  - `SELECT_UNIT` → `unit_selected`
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `unit_selection_required` _(allowed; stored as draft attachments)_
  - `ABANDON` → `intake_abandoned`

- `unit_selected`
  - `SUBMIT_INITIAL_MESSAGE` → `split_in_progress`
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `unit_selected` _(allowed)_
  - `ABANDON` → `intake_abandoned`

- `split_in_progress`
  - _(system)_ `LLM_SPLIT_SUCCESS` → `split_proposed`
  - _(system)_ `LLM_FAIL` → `llm_error_retryable` or `llm_error_terminal`
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `split_in_progress` _(allowed; does not cancel in-flight call)_
  - `ABANDON` → `intake_abandoned`

  - `ABANDON` → `intake_abandoned`

- `split_finalized`
  - _(system)_ `START_CLASSIFICATION` → `classification_in_progress`
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `split_finalized` _(allowed; attachment can be associated to resulting WOs)_
  - `ABANDON` → `intake_abandoned`

- `classification_in_progress`
  - _(system)_ `LLM_CLASSIFY_SUCCESS` → `needs_tenant_input` or `tenant_confirmation_pending`
  - _(system)_ `LLM_FAIL` → `llm_error_retryable` or `llm_error_terminal`
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `classification_in_progress` _(allowed)_
  - `ABANDON` → `intake_abandoned`

- `needs_tenant_input`
  - `ANSWER_FOLLOWUPS` → `classification_in_progress`
  - `SUBMIT_ADDITIONAL_MESSAGE` → `needs_tenant_input` _(queue or treat as clarification per §12)_
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `needs_tenant_input` _(allowed)_
  - `ABANDON` → `intake_abandoned`

- `tenant_confirmation_pending`
  - `CONFIRM_SUBMISSION` → `submitted`
  - `SUBMIT_ADDITIONAL_MESSAGE` → `tenant_confirmation_pending` _(queue; do not alter current submission unless tenant cancels)_
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `tenant_confirmation_pending` _(allowed)_
  - `ABANDON` → `intake_abandoned`

- `submitted`
  - `SUBMIT_INITIAL_MESSAGE` → start new intake cycle (new conversation or new cycle_id)
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `submitted` _(allowed; must attach to a specific WO via WO detail context)_
  - `RESUME` → `submitted`

- `llm_error_retryable`
  - _(system)_ `RETRY_LLM` → prior in-progress state
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `llm_error_retryable` _(allowed)_
  - `RESUME` → retry or show “try again”
  - `ABANDON` → `intake_abandoned`

- `llm_error_terminal`
  - `RESUME` → new intake cycle or “submit for human triage”
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `llm_error_terminal` _(allowed; attaches to triage stub if created)_
  - `ABANDON` → `intake_abandoned`

- `intake_abandoned`
  - `RESUME` → last active state (if not expired)
  - `UPLOAD_PHOTO_INIT/COMPLETE` → `intake_abandoned` _(allowed; draft attachments)_
  - _(system)_ `EXPIRE` → `intake_expired`

- `intake_expired`
  - `CREATE_CONVERSATION` → `intake_started`

**Photo attachment rules**:

- During intake: photos are stored as conversation draft attachments and later linked to created WOs (all WOs in the group by default unless tenant chooses specific issue mapping).
- After submission: photo uploads require a target `work_order_id` (from WO detail screen).

---

## 12) Draft discovery, additional message policy, and in-flight abandonment

### 12.1 Draft discovery endpoint

`GET /conversations/drafts` returns resumable drafts for tenant_user_id with states:  
`unit_selection_required, split_proposed, classification_in_progress, needs_tenant_input, tenant_confirmation_pending, llm_error_retryable, intake_abandoned`  
Order by `last_activity_at`, show up to 3.  
**Resumed conversations retain pinned versions.**

### 12.2 New issue during follow-ups (policy)

When in `needs_tenant_input` or `tenant_confirmation_pending`:

- If tenant sends free text (`SUBMIT_ADDITIONAL_MESSAGE`), determine whether it is clarification or a new issue.
- If new issue: queue it; finish current flow; offer immediate next intake using queued text after submission.

### 12.3 In-flight LLM call abandonment + artifact staleness

- Store LLM results even if tenant left.
- Artifacts expire by:
  - **Unseen artifacts** (never presented): expire after 60 minutes always.
  - **Seen artifacts**: stale if source hash changed, split hash changed, or age > 60 minutes AND borderline confidence.

---

## 13) Splitting

- Split first; classifier cannot run until split finalized.
- Split confirmation supports accept/merge/edit/add/reject.
- Tenant edit/add validation:
  - max 500 chars per issue
  - max 10 issues per conversation
  - sanitize input (strip control chars, escape HTML, normalize whitespace)

---

## 14) Classification, cue dictionaries, and confidence

### 14.1 Classification output

Taxonomy enums + confidence_by_field + missing_fields[].

### 14.2 Category gating error path

Contradictory outputs trigger one constrained retry, then human triage flag.

### 14.3 Confidence heuristic (MVP recipe)

Per field:
`conf = clamp01( 0.40*cue_strength + 0.25*completeness + 0.20*model_hint - 0.10*disagreement - 0.05*ambiguity_penalty )`

Model hint clamped to [0.2, 0.95] and scaled.

Threshold bands:

- High ≥ 0.85 accept
- Medium 0.65–0.84 ask if required/risk relevant
- Low < 0.65 must ask (unless not applicable)

**Bands are provisional**: validate and tune on Gold Set B before pilot launch.

### 14.4 Classification cue dictionaries (required artifact)

Add `packages/schemas/classification_cues.json` defining per-field keyword/regex cues used to compute `cue_strength`.

Minimal structure:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "fields": {
    "maintenance_category": {
      "plumbing": { "keywords": ["leak", "toilet", "sink", "drain"], "regex": [] },
      "electrical": { "keywords": ["breaker", "outlet", "switch", "sparks"], "regex": [] }
    },
    "maintenance_object": {
      "toilet": { "keywords": ["toilet", "wc"], "regex": [] }
    }
  }
}
```

Cue scoring rule:

- keyword hits and regex matches contribute to a normalized 0..1 score per candidate label; take the top score for `cue_strength`.

---

## 15) Follow-ups

- FollowUpGenerator input contract is strict and minimal.
- Output: max 3 questions per turn, each maps to one field, quick replies preferred.
- Termination caps: 8 turns, 9 questions, max 2 re-asks per field.
- Escape hatch: create WO with `needs_human_triage` if still incomplete.

Follow-ups must be recorded in `followup_events` with the schema in §7.1.

---

## 16) Tenant confirmation gate + staleness

- Tenant must confirm summary + key labels + risk confirmations before side effects.
- If tenant returns after >60 minutes at confirmation, run staleness check; re-run and re-confirm if stale.

---

## 17) Risk protocols + emergency router

- Deterministic trigger grammar: keyword_any / regex_any / taxonomy_path_any / requires_confirmation.
- Confirm emergency via yes/no before routing.
- Emergency router executes per-building chain; logs attempts.
- Exhaustion sets escalation_state=exhausted, triggers internal secondary alert, provides safe tenant message, optional retries.

### 17.1) Emergency confirmation action types

Emergency confirmation uses two **sidecar action types** that operate orthogonally to the main conversation state machine:

- **`CONFIRM_EMERGENCY`** — Tenant confirms the emergency. Sets `escalation_state` from `pending_confirmation` to `routing`, creates an escalation incident, and kicks off the async escalation coordinator. This is an explicit exception to non-negotiable #4 ("no side effects before CONFIRM_SUBMISSION"): emergency escalation may execute before work order submission, but only after explicit tenant confirmation.
- **`DECLINE_EMERGENCY`** — Tenant declines the emergency. Sets `escalation_state` from `pending_confirmation` to `none`. Returns safety messaging. No escalation incident is created.

Both are **sidecar actions**: they do not change the conversation `state` field. They are valid from any non-terminal conversation state when `session.escalation_state === 'pending_confirmation'`. They are rejected if `escalation_state` is any other value.

These actions are the second named exception set in the transition matrix (alongside photo actions). The dispatcher enforces that no more than these two named exception sets exist.

Quick-reply payloads for emergency confirmation include `action_type: 'CONFIRM_EMERGENCY'` and `action_type: 'DECLINE_EMERGENCY'` so the client dispatches them correctly. On reload/resume, the client synthesizes these quick replies from `risk_summary.escalation_state === 'pending_confirmation'` in the conversation snapshot.

### 17.2) Escalation runtime behavior

The escalation coordinator implements an asynchronous, multi-step workflow:

1. **Tenant confirms emergency** → `CONFIRM_EMERGENCY` handler creates an `EscalationIncident` record and initiates the first contact attempt.
2. **For each contact in the building's chain:**
   - Place a voice call (alerting only — no DTMF/IVR).
   - On call completion (answered or not), send an SMS prompt: "Reply ACCEPT to take ownership or IGNORE to pass."
   - Wait for SMS reply (default: 120 seconds).
3. **ACCEPT reply** → Incident claimed. Stand-down SMS sent to all previously contacted phones (excluding acceptor). Incident closed.
4. **IGNORE reply** → Advance to next contact in chain.
5. **No reply (timeout)** → Advance to next contact in chain (processed by cron).
6. **Chain exhausted** → Internal alert SMS sent to ops number. Cycle counter incremented. If below max cycles (default: 3), retry from top of chain after configured delay. If max cycles reached, incident closed as `exhausted_final`.

**Acceptance canonicality:** Acceptance is keyed by phone number (E.164), not contact_id. `accepted_by_phone` is the authoritative acceptance identity. Phone numbers are deduped within each retry cycle.

**Concurrent safety:** The incident store uses compare-and-swap (CAS) on `row_version` for all updates. Cron runs claim incidents with a processing lock (default: 90 seconds) before acting. Provider actions are tagged with idempotency keys to prevent duplicate calls/SMS on overlapping cron runs.

### 17.3) Feature flag and fail-closed behavior

Emergency routing is gated by the `EMERGENCY_ROUTING_ENABLED` environment variable. When `false` or unset:

- `CONFIRM_EMERGENCY` returns `EMERGENCY_ROUTING_UNAVAILABLE` error with safe 911 messaging. Writes an audit event. Does not advance `escalation_state` (remains at `pending_confirmation`).
- `DECLINE_EMERGENCY` works normally.
- Cron processor skips all incidents.
- `startIncident()` throws if called (defense-in-depth).

### 17.4) Webhook and cron surfaces

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/webhooks/twilio/voice-status` | POST | Voice call completion callback (Twilio signature validated) |
| `/api/webhooks/twilio/sms-reply` | POST | Inbound ACCEPT/IGNORE replies (Twilio signature validated) |
| `/api/cron/emergency/process-due` | GET | Cron-triggered: process timeouts, advance chain, schedule retries (Bearer token auth) |

### 17.5) Observability

The escalation coordinator emits structured JSON logs (`component: 'escalation_coordinator'`) for: incident started, call placed/failed, SMS sent/failed, reply received, incident claimed, CAS conflicts, cycle exhaustion, internal alerts, cron execution. All risk actions are recorded as append-only events in the conversation event log.

---

## 18) Concurrency, idempotency, and atomicity

- Idempotency keys for WO creation and notifications.
- Multi-WO creation is one DB transaction.
- Optimistic locking with `row_version` is required for mutable business records that may be concurrently edited, especially work orders.
- Accepted MVP decision (2026-03-11): conversation session persistence may remain dispatcher-mediated last-write-wins instead of `row_version`/CAS, as long as session writes stay behind the orchestrator boundary and this behavior is documented.
- Work orders independent post-creation; no group status stored.

---

## 19) Photos

- Photo schema includes sha256, scanned_status, storage_key.
- Presigned upload flow: init → direct upload → complete.
- Scanning is async; block PM visibility until clean.
- Attachment timing:
  - during intake (conversation attachments linked to WOs upon submission)
  - after submission (must target a work_order_id)

---

## 20) Notifications

- In-app + outbound SMS only.
- Preferences + SMS consent tracked; default SMS off until consent implemented.
- Batching: multi-issue creation sends one “created” notification.
- Deduping via idempotency + cooldown.

---

## 21) Tenant-copyable record bundle

- Minimal contents defined (created time, unit, summary, urgency basis, actions, status history, comms, schedule, resolution).
- Export endpoint returns JSON first; PDF later.

---

## 22) SLA policies (MVP compute + report only)

- SLA policy schema supports client defaults and taxonomy-path overrides.
- MVP computes SLA metadata and exposes in analytics/record bundle; no automated paging.

---

## 23) Mock ERP adapter

ERPAdapter interface:

- createWorkOrder
- getWorkOrderStatus
- syncUpdates
- healthCheck

Mock returns EXT-uuid and simulates transitions via polling or test endpoint.

---

## 24) API surface and payload mapping rule

### 24.1 Endpoints

### 24.2 Payload schema rule (authoritative)

Every endpoint request body maps directly to `OrchestratorActionRequest.tenant_input` for its action type, and returns `OrchestratorActionResponse`.

---

## 25) Observability

- Structured JSON logs with request_id, ids, action, state, latency, error codes.
- Metrics: LLM latency/errors, state durations, abandonment rate, escalation exhaustion, notification failures, schema failures.
- Required MVP health check: `/health`
- Optional dependency-specific health sub-routes: `/health/db`, `/health/llm`, `/health/storage`, `/health/notifications`, or adapter-specific routes such as `/health/erp`
- Alerts: escalation exhausted, LLM error spike, schema failures spike, async backlog.

---

## 26) Evaluation + deployment gates

- Gold sets A/B/C.
- Human override loop stored as events with reason codes.
- Versions pinned per conversation; CI gates prompt/model changes; canary + rollback.

---

## 27) Repo structure and governance

Recommended tree:

- AGENTS.md, PLANS.md
- apps/web
- packages/schemas
- packages/core
- packages/evals
- packages/adapters/mock
- docs
- CI workflow

AGENTS.md must include non-negotiables, commands, plan-first, TDD, taxonomy governance.

---

## 28) Build sequence (implementation-safe)

1. Schemas + validators + config objects
2. Auth/session scaffolding + conversation state machine (incl abandon/expire/error)
3. Orchestrator implementation + endpoint stubs + event append pattern
4. Splitter + split confirmation UI flows + tests
5. Classifier + **classification_cues.json** + category gating retry + confidence heuristic + tests
6. Follow-up generator + termination caps + followup_events + tests
7. Tenant confirmation UI + staleness checks
8. Transactional WO creation + idempotency + work-order optimistic locking
9. Risk protocols + mitigation templates + emergency router + exhaustion path
10. Notifications (delivery path first; tenant history/prefs can follow)
11. Record bundle export (JSON)
12. Mock ERP adapter + simulated status updates
13. Analytics slicing endpoints + dashboards (MVP-lite)

---

---

### Final authority order (implementation rule)

If anything is ambiguous, follow this precedence:

1. Transition matrix (§11.2)
2. Orchestrator contract (§10)
3. Rate limits/payload caps (§8)
4. Non-negotiables (§2)
5. Remaining sections in document order
